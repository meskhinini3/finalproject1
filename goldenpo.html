            <p>Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) is a tropical vine native to the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, but you probably know it best seen trailing off of shelves and desks. Pothos is commonly grown as a houseplant, boasting pointed, heart-shaped green leaves that are sometimes variegated with white, yellow, or pale green striations.

                Pothos plants can live for many years with basic care and are super adaptable, as various light, soil, and moisture conditions suit them. They're fast-growing plants even indoors, often adding between 12 to 18 inches of length in a month. Be aware that pothos plants are toxic to pets.</p>

                <h3>Pothos Care</h3>
                <p>
                    Caring for pothos is simple. This low-maintenance plant thrives in bright, indirect light, but it can also do well in low-light conditions. Pothos can thrive in standard houseplant potting mix or a chunky, well-draining aroid mix. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Feed the plant with balanced houseplant fertilizer each month during the spring and summer.

Because pothos can grow in low-light areas or those with only fluorescent lighting, it's an excellent houseplant for offices and dorm rooms.
                </p>
                <h3> Water</h3>
                <p>Let your pothos plant's soil dry out completely between waterings. If left in continually damp soil, the plant's roots will rot. Black spots on the leaves (or the sudden collapse of the plant) indicate that the soil has been kept too wet.2


                  The plant will indicate when it needs water. When it starts to droop, it needs water to revive it. However, do not wait until the leaves start to shrivel or the plant will lose some leaves. Dry, brown edges mean the plant was kept dry for too long.</p>
